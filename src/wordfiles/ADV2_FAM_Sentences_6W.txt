{<BT>|} 
I would like to be there. 
{<BT>|} 
It was not what I wanted. 
{<BT>|} 
There are two boys playing. 
{<BT>|}

{<BT>|} 
We made it in art class. 
{<BT>|}

{<BT>|}

{<BT>|} 
The children went out to play. 
{<BT>|}

{<BT>|} 
The plane went over the mountain. 
{<BT>|} 
I'm going back to my house. 
{<BT>|} 
She got in line after you. 
{<BT>|} 
Theres a good show on television. 
{<BT>|} 
That is a very large boat. 
{<BT>|} 
That was such a good dinner. 
{<BT>|}

{<BT>|} 
He was a very kind man. 
{<BT>|} 
I like to breathe fresh air. 
{<BT>|}

{<BT>|} 
I am going through the tunnel. 
{<BT>|} 
Are we going the right way? 
{<BT>|} 
She would also like to go. 
{<BT>|} 
That is a very small school. 
{<BT>|} 
He left because he was bored. 
{<BT>|} 
I wonder what I should do? 
{<BT>|} 
I am about to go to work. 
{<BT>|} 
Please be kind to each other. 
{<BT>|} 
He made me dinner last night. 
{<BT>|} 
Do you like to drink coffee? 
{<BT>|} 
I want to buy the other one. 
{<BT>|} 
Yes I am related to her. 
{<BT>|} 
Nobody can make you do anything. 
{<BT>|} 
Are you going out for lunch? 
{<BT>|} 
I think these belong to me. 
{<BT>|} 
It costs more for that car. 
{<BT>|} 
I drove my bike to school. 
{<BT>|} 
It is time to go now. 
{<BT>|} 
Did you like the long weekend? 
{<BT>|} 
There are four seasons in Canada.

{<BT>|} 
Will you be at my wedding. 
{<BT>|} 
You look good with blond hair. 
{<BT>|} 
I better not tell you now. 
{<BT>|} 
We had very nice weather today. 
{<BT>|} 
You and I are good friends. 
{<BT>|} 
I started my job last week. 
{<BT>|} 
That was a very good story. 
{<BT>|} 
How many miles away is Toronto? 
{<BT>|} 
I can do without my books. 
{<BT>|} 
That is a very good idea. 
{<BT>|} 
Can we swim in the river? 
{<BT>|} 
Can you watch that for me? 
{<BT>|} 
I like being at the pool. 
{<BT>|} 
Every day I go to work. 
{<BT>|} 
You can keep it for yourself. 
{<BT>|} 
Can I help you with something? 
{<BT>|} 
I have been waiting since lunch. 
{<BT>|} 
It is usually very good. 
{<BT>|} 
Are you sure it's all right? 
{<BT>|}

{<BT>|} 
Black is the opposite of white. 
{<BT>|} 
You have to measure the ingredients. 
{<BT>|}

{<BT>|} 
We will cover the full area. 
{<BT>|} 
How many birds did you see? 
{<BT>|}

{<BT>|} 
That was a very big ship. 
{<BT>|} 
I began to work out today. 
{<BT>|}
